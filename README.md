# Markdown editor

Single-file typescript markdown editor for the web.

Written in typescript, the final editor is contained in a single file and its aim is to provide very simple and easy to use interface while being 100% customizable. The editor has a custom markdown parsing engine, which allows dynamic parsing as the user types. Also provides a simple way to stylize all the markdown elements using CSS.
